# GitHub Pages Files Removed

The following files were added for GitHub Pages deployment and should be removed:

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `.github/` directory - Can be deleted entirely

These files are no longer needed since we're not using GitHub Pages deployment.
